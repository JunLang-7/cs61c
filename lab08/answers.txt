Exercise 1 Checkoff Questions:
    1. First get the virtual memory address and divide it into two fields: page and offset, then look at the TLB to find if it hits,
       and if it hits it would immediately return the physical address, once it's TLB miss, it should divide into the PAGE TABLE to look up,
       if its valid bit is 1, it leads to page hit and fetch the physical memory, otherwise it results in page fault, and the page should 
       be brought into physical memory from hard disk.
    2. Because it's its feature: Virtual memory allows programs to access more memory than is available in the real primary memory of the machine.

Exercise 4 Checkoff Question:
    1. Because it has mutiple processes(p1, p2, p3 and p4 are processes), every time when context switch, the TLB would get flushed, 
       for the virtual memory mapping in every process is different, and after that, new address mapping are not in TLB, resulting to high miss rate.
